# COBOL Business Rules Extraction - CardDemo Application

## Overview

This directory contains the comprehensive analysis and extraction of business calculation rules from the CardDemo COBOL application. The analysis was conducted as part of a modernization effort to identify and document business logic that needs to be preserved during system migration.

## Contents

### üìÑ [COBOL_Business_Rules_Analysis.md](./COBOL_Business_Rules_Analysis.md)
The main analysis document containing:
- Complete inventory of 4 business calculation rules
- Detailed documentation for each rule including source location, variables, conditions, and formulas
- Analysis methodology and exclusion criteria
- Modernization recommendations

Visual diagram showing:
- Relationships between business rules
- Shared dependencies across processes
- Process flow connections
- Critical integration points

## Analysis Summary

### Scope
- **Files Analyzed:** 18 COBOL programs
- **Total Lines of Code:** ~15,000+
- **Analysis Focus:** Business-level calculations only
- **Exclusions:** Technical validation, I/O operations, UI logic

### Key Findings

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Business Calculation Rules Identified | 4 |
| Programs with Business Logic | 3 |
| Shared Dependencies | 1 (Transaction ID Generation) |
| Critical Rules for Migration | 2 (Payment & Transaction ID) |

### Business Rules Identified

1. **RULE-CALC-001**: Bill Payment Balance Calculation
   - **Location**: COBIL00C.cbl:234
   - **Purpose**: Updates account balance during payment processing
   - **Priority**: High (Critical for payment accuracy)

2. **RULE-CALC-002**: Transaction ID Generation
   - **Location**: COBIL00C.cbl:216-217, COTRN02C.cbl:448-449
   - **Purpose**: Generates unique sequential transaction identifiers
   - **Priority**: High (Shared dependency across processes)

3. **RULE-CALC-003**: Daily Report Date Range Calculation
   - **Location**: CORPT00C.cbl:229-230
   - **Purpose**: Calculates previous day for daily reports
   - **Priority**: Medium (Reporting functionality)

4. **RULE-CALC-004**: Monthly Report Date Range Calculation
   - **Location**: CORPT00C.cbl:224-228
   - **Purpose**: Calculates first/last day of previous month for reports
   - **Priority**: Medium (Reporting functionality)

## Methodology

### Inclusion Criteria ‚úÖ
- Financial calculations (balance updates, payment processing)
- Business logic formulas (date calculations for reports)
- Conditional logic for business decisions
- Aggregation rules related to financial domain

### Exclusion Criteria ‚ùå
- Input validation rules
- Technical/infrastructure logic
- File handling operations
- Cursor processing
- Screen layout logic
- Error handling routines
- Database connection logic
- I/O operations

## Programs Analyzed

| Program | Purpose | Business Rules Found |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| COBIL00C.cbl | Bill Payment Processing | RULE-CALC-001, RULE-CALC-002 |
| COTRN02C.cbl | Transaction Addition | RULE-CALC-002 |
| CORPT00C.cbl | Report Generation | RULE-CALC-003, RULE-CALC-004 |
| COACTUPC.cbl | Account Update | None |
| COACTVWC.cbl | Account View | None |
| COADM01C.cbl | Admin Menu | None |
| COCRDLIC.cbl | Credit Card List | None |
| COCRDSLC.cbl | Credit Card Detail | None |
| COCRDUPC.cbl | Credit Card Update | None |
| COMEN01C.cbl | Main Menu | None |
| COSGN00C.cbl | Sign-on Processing | None |
| COTRN00C.cbl | Transaction List | None |
| COTRN01C.cbl | Transaction View | None |
| COUSR00C.cbl | User List | None |
| COUSR01C.cbl | User Addition | None |
| COUSR02C.cbl | User Update | None |
| COUSR03C.cbl | User Deletion | None |
| CSUTLDTC.cbl | Date Utility | None (Technical utility) |

## Modernization Impact

### Critical Dependencies
- **Transaction ID Generation (RULE-CALC-002)** is used by multiple business processes
- Must be implemented as a shared service in the modernized architecture
- Ensures transaction integrity across the entire system

### Implementation Priority
1. **High Priority**: Payment processing and transaction ID generation
2. **Medium Priority**: Reporting date calculations

### Architecture Considerations
- Transaction ID generation should be implemented as a centralized service
- Balance calculations require proper audit trails and error handling
- Date calculation rules can be implemented as reusable utility functions

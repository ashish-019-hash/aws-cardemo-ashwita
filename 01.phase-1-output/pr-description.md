# COBOL Screen Flow Analysis - Complete Business Navigation Documentation

## Overview

This pull request provides comprehensive analysis and documentation of the CardDemo COBOL application's screen flow architecture, focusing on business-level user navigation paths and screen transitions.

## Analysis Scope

**Complete Coverage**: Analyzed all 18 COBOL programs in the `00.phase-1-input` folder:
- Authentication: COSGN00C
- Menu Navigation: COMEN01C, COADM01C  
- Account Management: COACTVWC, COACTUPC, COBIL00C
- Card Operations: COCRDLIC, COCRDSLC, COCRDUPC
- Transaction Processing: COTRN00C, COTRN01C, COTRN02C
- User Administration: COUSR00C, COUSR01C, COUSR02C, COUSR03C
- Reporting: CORPT00C
- Utilities: CSUTLDTC

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Visual SVG Diagram (`cardemo-screen-flow-diagram.svg`)
- Complete screen flow architecture visualization
- Role-based authentication routing
- Menu navigation patterns
- Functional screen relationships
- PF key navigation flows
- Color-coded screen types and navigation patterns

### 2. Comprehensive Documentation (`cardemo-screen-flow-analysis.md`)
- Executive summary of screen flow architecture
- Complete Screen ID → Trigger/Option → Target Screen mapping table
- Detailed navigation patterns by functional area
- Standard PF key navigation patterns
- Technical architecture patterns
- Business process flows
- Security and access control documentation

## Key Findings

### Authentication & Navigation Architecture
- **Single Entry Point**: COSGN00C with role-based routing to admin (COADM01C) or user (COMEN01C) menus
- **Dynamic Menu System**: Menu options loaded via copybook arrays (CDEMO-MENU-OPT-PGMNAME, CDEMO-ADMIN-OPT-PGMNAME)
- **Standardized PF Keys**: Consistent navigation patterns (PF3=Exit, PF4=Clear, PF5=Actions, PF7/PF8=Pagination)

### Screen Flow Patterns
- **Account Management**: COACTVWC (view) ↔ COACTUPC (update) ↔ COBIL00C (billing)
- **Card Operations**: COCRDLIC (list) → COCRDSLC (detail) ↔ COCRDUPC (update)
- **Transaction Processing**: COTRN00C (list) → COTRN01C (view) ↔ COTRN02C (add)
- **User Administration**: COUSR00C (list) → COUSR01C/COUSR02C/COUSR03C (CRUD operations)

### Technical Patterns
- **CICS XCTL Transfers**: Program-to-program navigation with context preservation
- **CARDDEMO-COMMAREA**: Shared communication area for state management
- **Pseudo-Conversational Design**: Efficient resource utilization with state persistence
- **BMS Map Integration**: Screen interaction through SEND/RECEIVE patterns

## Focus Areas

✅ **Included**: Production user-facing screen flows, business navigation logic, menu systems, functional operations
❌ **Excluded**: Internal technical logic, data validations, calculations (unless impacting navigation), test/debug screens, unused flows

## Verification

- [x] All 18 COBOL programs analyzed and documented
- [x] SVG diagram accurately represents screen navigation architecture
- [x] Markdown documentation includes complete Screen ID/Title → Trigger → Target mapping
- [x] Business-level focus maintained throughout analysis
- [x] Standard navigation patterns documented across all programs
